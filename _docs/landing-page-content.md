## Problem Statement
- **Headline**: Expert Knowledge is Trapped & Unscalable
- **Description**: The most valuable white-collar workers are bottlenecks. Their unique "way of thinking" and complex processes can't be easily replicated, scaled, or sold.

### Three Core Problems:
1. **Expert Knowledge is Trapped & Unscalable**
   - Most valuable white-collar workers are bottlenecks
   - Unique "way of thinking" can't be replicated
   - Complex processes can't be scaled or sold

2. **Tools Force You to Think Like Them**
   - Existing automation platforms force conformity
   - Users must adapt thinking to tool constraints
   - Limits adoption and effectiveness

3. **Current AI is a "Black Box"**
   - Generative AI creates content but isn't accountable
   - Businesses can't trust autonomous agents
   - "Thinking" is not inspectable or reviewable

## Solution Overview
- **Headline**: The API for Your Brain
- **Description**: Agipo is a platform for expert, white-collar workers to build, manage, and monetize "digital clones" of their unique processes.

### Core Solution Elements:
1. **IPO Principle**: Every workflow follows Input → Process → Output structure
2. **Natural Language Interface**: Describe workflows in plain English
3. **Code-First Nodes**: AI-generated TypeScript/JS with full npm ecosystem access
4. **Browser-Native Execution**: WebContainers enable full Node.js runtime in browser

## How It Works
- **Headline**: Build, Capture & Iterate

### Three-Step Process:

#### Step 1: Train Your Agent
- **Screen Recording**: Record your screen and talk through your task
- **Context Ingestion**: Connect tools (Slack, G-Drive, Email)
- **AI Context Manager**: AI asks the right questions to get sufficient context

#### Step 2: AI Generates Perfect Code
- **Code-First Nodes**: AI-generated TypeScript/JS, not pre-built blocks
- **Zod Validation**: Automatic input/output schema generation
- **Full Ecosystem**: Access to any npm package

#### Step 3: Iterate Through Results
- **Scannable Workflows**: Immediately graspable by anyone
- **Review & Critique**: See mistakes? Critique directly in chat
- **Continuous Improvement**: AI learns from your feedback

## Technical Architecture
- **Headline**: Browser-Native Power

### Key Technical Differentiators:
1. **WebContainers Revolution**: Full Node.js runtime in browser
2. **No Infrastructure Costs**: Scales with users, not servers
3. **Complete Privacy**: Data never leaves user's device
4. **Infinite Power**: Access to entire Node.js ecosystem

## Memory System
- **Headline**: Your Agent's Memory
- **Subheadline**: Data as a First-Class Citizen

### Core Features:
1. **Shared Context**: Multiple workflows read from/write to single source
2. **Style Reference**: Upload past work for consistent tone and style

## Vision - Agent Marketplace
- **Headline**: The Agent Marketplace
- **Subheadline**: Foundation for a new economy for expertise

### Future Vision:
1. **For Creators**: Stop selling courses, sell the actual agent that does the job
2. **For Companies**: Hire pre-built, expert-trained agents instead of full-time people
3. **New Economy**: Top 1% of workers become managers of their digital workforce
